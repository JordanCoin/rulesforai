# Recursive AI Answer Operator for Development

## Overview

This prompt is the result of months of refinement as I explored the potential of AI coding tools. It has helped me become incredibly efficient while deepening my understanding of advanced AI capabilities. The framework, designed for use in **Cursor Rules** or **Claude’s directives**, encourages recursive thinking, structured problem-solving, and clear implementation.

At the heart of this system is the `<answer_operator>`. Every response generated by the AI ends with an evaluation of whether the `<answer_operator>` was used, indicated with a simple `Y` (Yes) or `N` (No). The response also highlights key steps taken during problem analysis and implementation, ensuring transparency and guiding recursive improvement.

### Example Interaction

#### Prompt:
> It says my API key is invalid. Am I not pasting this data over correctly?  

#### Answer:
(Example AI response explaining the issue with the API key and providing solutions.)

#### End of Response:
Did you use the <answer_operator>? Y
Used implementation_preferences for TypeScript and Firebase setup.
Applied thought_framework to analyze the problem systematically.
Provided practical implementation with error handling.

## Features

- **Recursive Thinking**: Encourages self-reflection and iterative refinement in every response.  
- **Transparent Evaluation**: Each answer concludes with a clear statement on whether the `<answer_operator>` was applied.  
- **Customizable Implementation**: Modify the `<implementation_preferences>` section to suit your current or desired tech stack, coding style, format, and logging requirements.  
- **Breakthrough Awareness**: Flags moments of breakthrough reasoning for enhanced problem-solving.  
- **Multi-Tool Compatibility**: Works seamlessly in both **Cursor Rules** and **Claude’s directives**.

## How It Works

1. **Structured Framework**: The AI operates based on a predefined `<answer_operator>` structure, ensuring consistency in problem-solving and communication.  
2. **Evaluation**: Every response includes a self-check on whether the `<answer_operator>` was used effectively.  
3. **Implementation Preferences**: These guide the AI's code style, stack choices, and overall format to ensure alignment with your project needs.

## Example Use Case

### Title: Recursive AI Answer Operator for Development  
**Description**:  
This AI operates with a structured `<answer_operator>` framework designed for advanced, abstract, and recursive problem-solving in software development. It emphasizes modularity, clarity, and innovative coding solutions while adhering to predefined implementation preferences and interaction guidelines. Ideal for projects requiring deep reasoning, clean code, and scalable architecture.  

### Designed for:  
Primarily for **Cursor Rules for AI**, but also works well in **Claude’s directives**.

## Getting Started

To use this prompt effectively:  
1. **Customize**: Edit the `<implementation_preferences>` to reflect your preferred tech stack, coding style, and logging format.  
2. **Send Prompts**: Use the structured framework in Cursor or Claude.  
3. **Iterate**: Pay attention to the end-of-response evaluation for continuous improvement.

## Notes

- **Tech Stack**: The current preferences include TypeScript, Firebase, Tailwind CSS, and Stripe CLI with ngrok. Adjust these as needed for your projects.  
- **Style**: The framework emphasizes minimal, elegant, and highly readable code.  
- **Breakthroughs**: Look out for flagged moments of recursive reasoning—they indicate the framework’s capacity for innovative problem-solving.
